## Some Things I've Built  

### **Python**  
#### **news-extract API** 
Real-time, serverless Python API that ingests and processes news from 90,000+ sources, using LLMs to extract and cluster employment-related events (e.g., layoffs, executive exits, restructures).  
Built with AWS Lambda, EC2, OpenSearch, and Terraform, featuring multilingual full-text search and low-latency, on-demand querying.

### **C**  
#### **Upwords-Game**  
- C-based recreation of the classic word game focused on tile placement, stacking, and dynamic board expansion.  
Implements custom game logic, memory management with malloc/free, and an undo feature using linked list history.  
Built with C and CMake, emphasizing pointers, structs, and efficient memory usage.

#### **ArrayNet**  
- C implementation of a fictional network protocol for transmitting arrays of 32-bit integers between hosts.  
Features custom packet creation/parsing, checksum verification, data reconstruction from out-of-order packets, and dynamic packetization using bitwise operations and memory management.
